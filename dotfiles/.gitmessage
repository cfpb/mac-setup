# 1. Commit summary. Keep it under 50 characters. @-symbol above is a
#    marker for that. Don't end it with a period. Imperative mood.
#
# 2. Description of commit should explain WHY a change was made and
#    lines should be wrapped to 72 characters; marked by the #-symbol.
#
# 3. Optionally, reference a GH issue number or other links.
